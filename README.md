# Dagger 2

## Main Components of Dagger 2
1. @Module : Classes annotated with @Module are responsible for providing objects which can be injected. Such classes define methods annotated with @Provides. The returned objects from these methods are available for dependency injection.
2. @Inject : Known as Dependency consumer, The @Inject annotation is used to define a dependency.
3. @Component : A @Component annotated interface defines the connection between the provider of objects (modules) and the objects which express a dependency. The class for this connection is generated by the Dagger.

## Limitations Of Dagger 2
1. Dagger 2 Does not inject fields automatically
2. It cant inject Private fields.
3. If you want to use fields injection you have to define a method in your @component annotated interface which takes the instance of the class into which you want to inject the member variable.
